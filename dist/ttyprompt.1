.SH DESCRIPTION
It's easy to log keyboard presses in X Window System, just run the following command:
.PP
.nf
    xinput test 9
.fi
.PP
You will see "scan code" of each pressed and released key. Even with AppArmor
and firejail. If there is security breach in your browser, your passwords can
be stolen.
.PP
Not good, right? Yes, you can use Wayland but some people have reasons to stay
with X.Org. This program provides a good workaround for these people.
.PP
ttyprompt "jumps" to prompt TTY, writes simple prompt, reads passwords and
"jumps" back. Easy? Easy and xinput is blind.
.PP
.B Note:
Last two commands are wrappers that allow to use ttyprompt as a pinentry or
ssh-askpass implementation.
